# Fotrino

This project is actively being developed and is not yet ready for use. Until I reach version 1.0, **updates might break existing installs** (eg. I won't provide DB migrations).

**Privacy Warning** The [URLs to access your photos](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) are valid for 24 hours and will work even if you are logged out. In other words, someone with access to your browser history/cache could access your photos.
